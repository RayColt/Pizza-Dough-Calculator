Pizza Dough Calculator, just copy the html file to your phone, tabloid or computer!<br/>
Change its constants to your own convenience. I am testing these ones at the moment, for example:<br />
	const salt = 0.02;<br />
	const yeast = 0.028;<br />
	const sugar = 0.032;<br />
	const water = 0.38;<br />
	const magarine = 0.2;<br />
<br />
If you use bread improver like Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) you can still add it to the script. I prefer Citric Acid. Around 0.25 gr for 250 grams flour.
<br/><br/>The bakerâ€™s humidity percentage formula:<br/> 
For 100 grams of flour and a hydration level of 60%, you would need 60 grams of water. <br /><br />
The dough weight is equal to the weight of the flour plus the weight of the water(fluids).<br/><br />
